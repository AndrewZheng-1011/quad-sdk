# Running tail scripts

## Simulation single
Run the shell file script in the following methods

```
roscd quad_utils/scripts
chmod +x run_batch_simulation_single.py
./run_batch_simulation_single.py <env_type> <batch_num> <tail_type>
```

where:
- env_type is the environments with different elevation ranging from 0-11 (0 lowest, 11 highest)
- batch_num is the batch it is ran (a way to keep up with the file)
- tail type is whether to have no tail (0), nmpc tail (1), or simply feedback tail (2).

To run without script:
```
roslaunch quad_utils quad_gazebo.launch tail:=true tail_type:=1
roslaunch quad_utils standing.launch
```

## Run Double Pendulum Quadruped Sequential Open Loop Tail Control
```
roscd quad_utils/scripts
./run_batch_simulation_single.py <env_type> <batch_num> 3 true <tail_num> <ff_torque_1> <ff_torque_2> <time_1> <time_2>
```

where:
- env_type is the environments with different elevation ranging from 0-11 (0 lowest, 11 highest)
- batch_num is the batch initial spawn point (working 40)
- 3 is to run sequential open loop tail control
- true: To run the dira setup (i.e. double pendulum tails)
- tail_num: Number of tail link (range is 1-2)
- ff_torque_1: The first open loop torque (working 30)
- ff_torque_2: The second open loop torque (working -45)
- time_1: ros time to execute ff_torque_1 (working 4.75)
- time_2: ros time to execute ff_torque_2 (working 5)

## Run script to run batches of Sequential Open Loop Tail Control

```
./run_batch_simulation_dira.py
```



# TODO
Currently need to:
1) Find out how to execute a open-loop control for multi-link tail
2) Form dynamic model
3) Get data & results
